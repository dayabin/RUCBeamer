# RUCBeamer
 This is an RUC beamer LaTex template to be used in R Markdown. This template was developed based upon Dr. Miller's [work](http://svmiller.com/blog/2019/08/r-markdown-template-beamer-presentations/). 

Note that in the YAML, change the template path to the path in your local machine. Also, to use your own logo, go to the RUCTemplate.tex file, search for "\titlegraphic" and change the path there into the path on your local machine.

# RUCBeamer
 This is an RUC beamer LaTex template to be used in R Markdown. This template was developed based upon Dr. Miller's [work](http://svmiller.com/blog/2019/08/r-markdown-template-beamer-presentations/). 

Note that in the YAML of the RUCBeamer.Rmd file, remember to change the template path to the path in your local machine (because I used an absolute path). Also, to use your own logo (title graphic), go to the RUCTemplate.tex file, search for "\titlegraphic" and change the logo path there to the path on your local machine.
